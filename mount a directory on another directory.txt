Yes but before I go that far, couldn't you just symlink?

ln -s /media/tc1/folder ~/home
This link is just a file that is interpreted. It is automatically permanent (until you delete the file).

Failing that you can use mount as you described but the syntax is slightly different:

mount --bind /media/tc1/folder /home/dvad/home
This is not permanent at all, and will be nuked by a restart. If you want it to persist, you'll need something in your /etc/fstab like this:

/media/tc1/folder    /home/dvad/home    none    bind
If you're trying a mount and it's not working, you should make sure that the block-level device is mounted. You can't directly mount a subdirectory of a partition without first mounting the partition.
