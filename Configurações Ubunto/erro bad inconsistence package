1. Make sure that your PPA is set up.
2. Remove the broken package via the following command:
sudo dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq zramswap-enabler
3. Install the package again:
sudo apt-get install zramswap-enabler
4. After restart (not necessary), you are able to install the updates correctly!
Actually you can fix any "Package is in a very bad inconsistent state” issues with this solution!
