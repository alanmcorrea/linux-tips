"Too many open files" errors happen when a process needs to open more files than it is allowed by the operating system. This number is controlled by the maximum number of file descriptors the process has.


The number of file descriptors for the current process can be shown with the following commands:

[root@mdw ~]# ulimit -a | grep open
open files (-n) 524288

[root@mdw ~]# ulimit -n 524288
