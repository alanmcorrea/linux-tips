

    Install the yum-utils package:
    Raw

    # yum install yum-utils

    The package-cleanup --dupes lists all duplicate packages:
    Raw

    # package-cleanup --dupes        

    The package-cleanup --cleandupes removes the duplicates (it asks for a confirmation to remove all duplicates unless the -y switch is given):
    Raw

    # package-cleanup --cleandupes   

    Edit /etc/yum.conf, set the following line:
    Raw

    exactarch=1

    Run yum command:
    Raw

    # yum clean all
    # yum update

If the conflict is only due to the fact that yum isn't trying to update the 32 bit packages along with the 64 bit ones, this will solve the conflict.

Note: If all above procedure fail, you can also check your exclude content in /etc/yum.conf file. Sometimes 32Bits Packages are in the yum blacklist and system will prevent it to install and you will see the Transaction Check Error.
Raw

# grep -i exclude /etc/yum.conf
exclude=kernel*,*.i?86

Note 2: In case the systems cannot be connected to the internet for security reasons, one could replace the files with the rpm command as follow:
Raw

rpm -Uvh --replacefiles openssl-*.rpm
