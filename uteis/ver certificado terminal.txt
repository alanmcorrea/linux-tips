OpenSSL will allow you to look at it if it is installed on your system.

openssl x509 -in cerfile.cer -noout -text

The format of the .CER file might require that you specify a different encoding format to be explicitly called out.

openssl x509 -inform pem -in cerfile.cer -noout -text

or

openssl x509 -inform der -in cerfile.cer -noout -text
