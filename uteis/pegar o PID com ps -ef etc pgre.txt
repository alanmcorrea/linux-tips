pgrep -f keyword

From the man page:

    -f       The pattern is normally only matched against the process name. When -f is set, the full command line is used.

If you really want to avoid pgrep, try:

ps -ef | awk '/[k]eyword/{print $2}'

Note the [] around the first letter of the keyword. That's a useful trick to avoid matching the awk command itself.
